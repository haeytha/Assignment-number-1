I have enjoyed starting with GitHub in a simple way. It was something new I learned, beginning with this tool using a user interface instead of 
 the command line. Was it great at performing tasks manually rather than typing. Therefore, I am very excited to do more assignments in the future. Additionally, starting with the basics is harder, but it will establish a solid foundation for my skills.
The workflow was new to me, even though I have worked with GitHub before. It was new for me to use the plugin to see the workflow, and I didnâ€™t know I could create it inside the repository.
